    "Separate into training and testing, as we will we doing some hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- For now we don't balance the original data, we may do it inside the model.\n",
    "- For now we are not standarizing anythin either, this can be changed and optimized.\n",
    "- Drop variables in full dataset we have that are full zeros or full ones we can never gain any information from those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach from class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BASELINE: Lasso for different alphas, this will give us different features, and data coded -1,1 so we can interpret as a linear probability model. We do not change the threshold so the threshold is 0. Advantage, no hypertuning, we can do this on the whole data. Alpha range from: {0.001, 0.040 tentative} and we get balanced accuracy on the test of 0.8 to below. \n",
    "  2. (1.1) We start tuning the threshold. This means hyper parameter tuning. We use 5 fold cross validation. The cross validation only occurs within the training data. What are we hyperparameter tuning? We just change the threshold, so we hyperparameter tune over optimal threshold and we take the average thresholds over the folds as the optimal threshold. Then we fit a lasso on the whole training data and we get a prediction based on optimal threshold for maximizing balanced accuracy. We iterate this procedure across many alphas. Gives like 0.87 for 20 features more or less.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Both approaches give us a plot of features vs balanced accuracy. We can consider them different models or we can consider them one. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Forward feature selection:\n",
    "- We need to cut the initial number of variables somehow or this gets too computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Lasso is an aggressive way of cutting the variables, I think it will select p_lasso = N as a maximum, so it is very greedy. Use 0.0001 687 features.\n",
    "- Then this forward feature selection is another greedy approach. But nothing wrong with being greedy.\n",
    "Forward feature selection, does badly with local minima, maybe we have to tune that. Auto stops when two consecutive iterations can't improve. So in a sense prevents from overfitting but it also prevents from seeing beyond the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooking our own approaches: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lasso + SVM ():\n",
    "   For different alphas we train a Lasso on the whole data. We get a subset of X; based on which coefficients for the Lasso are not equal to 0. We then trained an out of the box SVC(radial kernel, we do not need any modifications, it just uses predict.). \n",
    "   WE DO SET: Class weights to balanced, this improves performance a bit, careful about doing this ad-hoc hyper parameter tuning. This was my hallucinations or not? WE should be careful.\n",
    "    7 features with 0.91 accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Lasso + SVM() + threshold tuning ():\n",
    "For different alphas we train a Lasso on the whole data. We get a subset of X; based on which coefficients for the Lasso are not equal to 0. We then trained an out of the box SVC(radial kernel, probability=True). This returns a probability for each class, we use the probability for the positive class to tune the threshold.\n",
    "    0.89 without class balance or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "USE THIS THRESHOLD TUNING FOR PART 1, let's see if I can get a bit more.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is variance thresholding used? It doesn't make too much sense to me."
